Technologies Used:

Backend Framework & Runtime:

Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment
Express.js - Web application framework
TypeScript - Typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced development


File Handling:

Multer - Middleware for handling multipart/form-data and file uploads


Data Management:

JSON File Storage - Temporary data storage solution
Slugify - For generating URL-friendly slugs from titles


Development & Testing:

Jest - Testing framework for unit and integration tests
ts-node - TypeScript execution environment
nodemon - Development server with auto-reload capability


Code Quality & Type Safety:

TypeScript's built-in type checking
ESLint (implied by project structure) - Code quality tool
Type definitions for Express and Node


Environment & Configuration:

dotenv - Environment variable management
Custom middleware for request validation
Error handling middleware



The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

Controllers handle business logic
Middleware manages file uploads and validation
Routes define API endpoints
Models structure data representation
Type definitions ensure data consistency

This tech stack makes the project highly maintainable, type-safe, and ready for scaling. While currently using JSON file storage, the architecture is designed to easily accommodate a database integration for production use.
The project would be particularly suitable for:

Hotel booking platforms
Property management systems
Travel agencies requiring a hotel management backend
Vacation rental management systems
